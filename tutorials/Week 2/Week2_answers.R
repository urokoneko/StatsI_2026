### Measures of central tendency (mean, median) and variability (variance, sd) ###

# Income
mean_income <- mean(df$income)
median_income <- median(df$income)
var_income <- var(df$income)
sd_income <- sd(df$income)


# Education
mean_edu <- mean(df$edu)
median_edu <- median(df$edu)
var_edu <- var(df$edu)
sd_edu <- sd(df$edu)

var_edu
sd_edu

# Comment:
# - Mean: average value, sensitive to outliers
# - Median: midpoint of the distribution, robust to outliers
# - Variance/SD: how spread out the values are
# - Standard Error (SE): how uncertain our estimate of the mean is


# Standard Error (SE) of the mean:
# SE = sd / sqrt(n)
# - Standard deviation (sd) measures how spread out the individual data points are.
# - Standard error (se) measures how much the sample mean itself would vary
#   if we repeatedly took new samples from the population.
#   → Larger n → smaller SE (mean estimate is more precise).
#   → Larger sd → larger SE (mean estimate is less precise).
# We use SE to build confidence intervals and perform hypothesis tests.
se_income <- sd_income / sqrt(length(df$income))
se_edu <- sd_edu / sqrt(length(df$edu))

# 6. Central Limit Theorem (CLT) Example

# The CLT tells us: the sampling distribution of the mean approaches normality
# as the NUMBER of sample size increases, regardless of the original population distribution.
# though the original pop. distribution isn't a crazy distribution

sample_means_n10000 <- data.frame("mean"=replicate(10000, mean(sample(df$income, size = 500, replace = TRUE))), "n"=10000)

# Combine sampling distributions

# Interpretation:
# - With small n (50), distribution of sample means is wider and not perfectly normal.
# - With larger n (1000, 1000), distribution of sample means becomes narrower
#   and closer to normal, centered on the population mean.

# We learned that the sampling distribution of the mean always 
# approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the shape or size of the original
# distribution!

# Income, for example, is usually not really normally distributed.
# First, we generate some hypothetical income data.
